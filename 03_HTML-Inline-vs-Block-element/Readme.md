# Inline and block Elements in HTML

## Block Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: `<p>` and `<div>`.

> - The `<p>` element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

> - The `<div>` element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

## Inline Elements
Inline elements are elements that only take up the space of their content and do not force a line break. They are used to wrap a small section of text or an image.

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

> - This is a `<span>` element inside a paragraph.
