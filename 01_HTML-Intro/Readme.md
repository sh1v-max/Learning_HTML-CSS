# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of a website, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like **CSS** (for styling) and **JavaScript** (for interactivity).

## Key Features:

- **Simple to Learn:** HTML uses a straightforward tag-based syntax.
- **Content Structuring:** Organizes headings, paragraphs, images, links, and multimedia.
- **Platform Independent:** Works on all browsers and devices.
- **Integration Friendly:** Easily integrates with CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies.

A simple HTML document looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This basic structure forms the foundation of every webpage you see on the internet.
